    description: "Warehouses can be set to automatically suspend when thereâ€™s no activity after a specified period of time. Auto-suspend is enabled by specifying the time period (minutes, hours, etc.) of inactivity for the warehouse. Snowflake recommends setting auto-suspend according to your workload and your requirements for warehouse availability: If you enable auto-suspend, we recommend setting it to a low value (e.g. 5 or 10 minutes or less) because Snowflake utilizes per-second billing. This will help keep your warehouses from running (and consuming credits) when not in use."
