    description: "With multi-cluster warehouses, Snowflake supports allocating, either statically or dynamically, additional clusters to make a larger pool of compute resources available. For a warehouse, it is possible to specify minimum number of clusters that will run when the warehouse is resumed. This feature is available only in Snowflake Enterprise edition (or higher)."
